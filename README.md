# Marble Ball Dash
#### About
The original Marble Ball Dash was released on 3rd September 2010.
It was my first game I made myself (I was 14 back then).

It is available on [IndieDB](https://www.indiedb.com/games/marble-ball-dash)

Marble Ball Dash is written in [Lite-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lite-C) using [3D Gamestudio 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_GameStudio)

#### This repo
This is an updated version of the original. The entire code base has been rewritten and ported to Acknex Engine 8. Assets have been updated and redesigned - with the intention to keep as close to the original as possible.

Physics may behave differently as [ODE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Dynamics_Engine) has been replaced with [PhysX by Nvidia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhysX).
The game plays differently in certain areas compared to the original.

#### How to run
For Ogg Vorbis playback you need to install the Codec **OggDS0995.exe** which can be found in the **tools** directory
